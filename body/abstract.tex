Manufacturing facilities with legacy equipment face significant challenges in optimizing production schedules, often relying on manual planning methods that lead to inefficient resource utilization. This project presents TaskAlign, an AI-driven task scheduling system designed specifically for factories without built-in sensor technology. The proposed system optimizes machine usage and workforce allocation through task sequencing algorithms, enabling factories to undergo digital transformation without requiring expensive equipment upgrades. TaskAlign provides production managers with a user-friendly interface for manual data input and schedule visualization, addressing key challenges including inefficient task scheduling, and machine underutilization. The system analyzes available machines and their capabilities to create optimized production schedules that minimize idle time between operations. By implementing TaskAlign, factories can reduce downtime, improve productivity, and enhance scalability when incorporating new product lines. The solution supports factories in their digital transformation journey by providing an accessible approach to production optimization that works with existing machinery.
