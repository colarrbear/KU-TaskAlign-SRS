Manufacturing facilities, particularly electronic factories with legacy equipment, face significant challenges in optimizing production schedules, often relying on manual planning methods that lead to inefficient resource utilization. This project presents TaskAlign, an task scheduling system designed specifically for electronics manufacturing plants without built-in sensor technology. The proposed system optimizes machine usage and workforce allocation through task sequencing algorithms, enabling factories to undergo digital transformation without requiring expensive equipment upgrades.
TaskAlign provides production managers with a user-friendly interface for manual data input and schedule visualization, addressing key challenges such as inefficient task scheduling and machine underutilization. The system analyzes available machines and their capabilities to create optimized production schedules that optimizing user's criteria between operations. By implementing TaskAlign, electronics factories can improve productivity, and enhance scalability when incorporating new product lines. The solution supports factories in their digital transformation journey by providing an accessible approach to production optimization that works with existing machinery.
